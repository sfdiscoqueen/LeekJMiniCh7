// Mini-Challenge #7 "Reverse it"
// This is a program that takes a sequence of numbers or letters and reverses them

// peer review: Reed Goodwin - Works well and effectcive. Feels very user friendly and looks good! The only thing I could find was when you just pressed "enter" instead of entering a number or word it still tries to reverse it instead of validating
